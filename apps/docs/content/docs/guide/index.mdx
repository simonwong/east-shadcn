# Introduction

This is a component library base on [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). 
Make it as simple and convenient as a component library to use shadcn-ui, and enhanced commonly used components.

Of course, you can also fork this repository to create your own component library,
or directly copy certain component codes into your own project.

## The difference with shadcn/ui

- Simplify the use of components and reduce the large amount of boilerplate code brought by integrated components. Use the props of each part to transmit. (Although this is not the best practice, it is simple)
- Unified component usage, rather than being fixated on using either the Sonar or the Toast, the Drawer or the Sheet
